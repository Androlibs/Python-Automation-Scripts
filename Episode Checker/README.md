# Episode Checker

These scripts check and notify you of the latest episode releases of your favourite TV Show/Anime.  
It works in two modes:  
   - **Local File** Mode:  
In this mode, the script checks for the directory of the show in the path provided. Then it checks the directory for the latest downloaded episode, if the episode after that is released, it will notify you.
- **Timed** Mode:  
In this mode, the script crawles wikipedia to see, if any episode has been released within the last week. If yes, it notifies you of the release.

The Anime checker, works only in *Local File* mode.
